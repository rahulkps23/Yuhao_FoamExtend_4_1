This test case serves to verify the time and under-relaxation consistent
formulation developed by CFD@FSB group (University of Zagreb). Pressure is
probed at four corners and in the centre of the lid driven cavity. Five
simulations are performed with five different under-relaxation pairs:
    1. alphaU = 0.8, alphap = 0.2
    2. alphaU = 0.7, alphap = 0.3
    3. alphaU = 0.6, alphap = 0.4
    4. alphaU = 0.5, alphap = 0.5
    5. alphaU = 0.4, alphap = 0.6
Tolerances for all equations are very small, yielding extremely small (O(1e-11))
differences in converged pressure field. If the differences are larger - it
means that the converged solution is dependend on relaxation factors.
