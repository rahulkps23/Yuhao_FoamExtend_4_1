This test case serves to verify the time and under-relaxation consistent
formulation developed by CFD@FSB group (University of Zagreb). Pressure is
probed at four corners and in the centre of the lid driven cavity. Four
simulations are performed with four different time steps spanning four orders of
magnitude: 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001 and 0.00001 s. Tolerances for all equations are
very small, yielding extremely small (O(1e-11)) differences in converged
pressure field. If the differences are larger - it means that the converged
solution depends on the time step size.
