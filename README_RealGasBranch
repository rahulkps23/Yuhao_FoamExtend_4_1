Features


/*************************************Libraries**************************************************/

1. Included cubic equations of state for pure fluid.
   --> Redlich Kwong --> class = redlichKwong
   --> Peng Robinson --> class = pengRobinson
   --> Soave Redlich Kwong --> class = soaveRedlichKwong
   --> Aungier Redlich Kwong --> class = aungierRedlichKwong

2. Included cubic equations of state for mixtures.
   TODO: connect the classes to the reaction models
   -->class = mixtureRedlichKwong
   -->class = mixturePengRobinson
   -->class = mixtureSoaveRedlichKwong
   -->class = aungierSoaveRedlichKwong

3. Included a new Thermo model
   --> enthalpy calculated using NASA heat capacity polynomical
       Added real gas correction in class
       class = nasaHeatCapacityPolynomial

4. Minor changed in thermo related models so that they can be used with real gas classes
   --> class = realGasSpecieThermo
   --> class = sutherland
   --> class = const
   --> class = basicMixture
   --> class = basicPsiThermo

5. Added enthalpy and internal energy thermodynamic class based on basicPsiThermo for real gases
   --> enthalpy based thermo model, class = realGasHThermo
   --> internal energy based thermo model, class = realGasEThermo

6. Added high precision water properties (IAPWS97) based on freeSteam (external program, not included)
   Classes will not be compiled by Allwmake file
   Classes will compile without freeSteam. Freesteam is loaded at runTime (see Tutorial)
   --> classes = externalMedia/IAPWS_Waterproperties

/*************************************Solver**************************************************/

1. Changed pressure equation of rhoPisoFoam. Orginal pressure equation assumes perfect gas
   (linear relationship between pressure and density)
   --> new solver = realFluidPisoFoam

/*************************************Tutorials**************************************************/

1. pure fluid real gas mixture tutorial
   --> realFluidPisoFoam/ras/backStep

2. IAPWS97 water properties tutorial
   freeSteam must be installed for this tutorial
   additional classes loaded in controlDict
   --> realFluidPisoFoam/ras/cavity_IAPWS97
