###############################################################################

** Overview
  The foam-extend project is a fork of the OpenFOAM® open source
  library for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). It is an open
  project welcoming and integrating contributions from all users and
  developers. Previously known as OpenFOAM-dev and OpenFOAM-extend,
  it contains bug fixes and performance improvements, as well as
  extensions and additional features provided by community
  contributors (see file ListOfContributors).
  For a full list, see below and previous release notes at:
  http://sourceforge.net/p/foam-extend/wiki/Home/

  Version 4.1, nicknamed "Duisburg", is the current version of
  foam-extend. The release continues the tradition and spirit of the
  original FOAM code developed by prof. Jasak and Mr. Weller during
  their time at Imperial College and released as the general purpose
  CFD/CCM package by Nabla Ltd. in 2000. In this spirit, we reverted
  18 December 2013 to the original numbering scheme (foam-2.3.2, 13
  December 2004) as release number 3.0.  Visit http://foam-extend.org
  for more information.

  OPENFOAM is a registered trademark of ESI Group. OpenFOAM-extend and
  foam-extend are a community effort not endorsed by ESI Group.


  This is a major release of foam-extend-4.1 created form the nextRelease branch of foam-extend-4.0 which consolidates cumulative development since 2016.

** Compatibility
  Upstream features from the OpenFOAM® code base are merged into
  foam-extend on regular basis. The interface format of
  foam-extend-4.1 is largely compatible to foam-extend-4.0, to
  OpenFOAM-1.6-ext and OpenFOAM-1.7.x. In some cases, the
  differences are caused by bug fixes and algorithmic improvements,
  considered more important than inter-operability.

** Main differentiators between foam-extend and OpenFOAM
  A large number of features have been lost within the release of
  OpenFOAM since version 1.3, the code base has shrunk by more than
  40%.  While we understand the lack of technical ability of
  supporting advanced CFD features, we feel that existing features and
  specifically large-scale contributions should remain active and
  developed further. Below is a list of main features of foam-extend
  which are lacking, lost, deactivated or unusable in ESI releases:

  * Turbomachinery features, including General Grid Interface (GGI),
    partial overlap GGI, cyclic GGI, with improvements in parallel
    scaling.  First release of a mixing plane stage interface

  * Dynamic mesh with topological changes Sliding interfaces, mesh
    layering, attach-detach boundaries etc.  In foam-extend, full
    parallel support for topological changes is released for the first
    time

  * Finite Element Method with support for polyhedral meshes This is
    mainly used in mesh deformation and over the last 15 years it has
    proven vastly superior to all other dynamic mesh methods.

  * Advanced mesh deformation technology Including tet FEM mesh
    deformation, Radial Basis Function (RBF) mesh deformation,
    tetrahedral remeshing dynamic mesh support and solid body motion
    functions.  All of the above include parallelisation support

  * Library of dynamic meshes with topological changes with full
    second order FVM discretisation support on moving meshes with
    topological changes

  * Internal combustion engine-specific dynamic mesh classes such as
    two-stroke engine and various forms of 4-stroke and multi-valve
    dynamic mesh classes

  * Finite Area Method providing support for FVM-like discretisation
    on a curved surface in 3-D, with examples of liquid film modeling

  * Block-coupled matrix support, allowing fully implicit
    multi-equation solution of NxN equation sets, with full
    parallelisation support.  First release of a block-AMG linear
    equation solver

  * Fully implicit conjugate-coupled solution framework, allowing
    implicit solution fo multiple equations over multiple meshes, with
    parallelism

  * Proper Orthogonal Decomposition data analysis tools, with
    applications to FOAM field classes

  * Equation reader classes and tutorials

  * Multi-solver solution framework, allowing multiple field models to
    be solved in a coupled manner

  * A major contribution is solid mechanics modelling, including
    linear and non-linear materials, contact, self-contact and
    friction, with updated Lagrangian or absolute Lagrangian
    formulation.  Solution of damage models and crack propagation in
    complex materials via topological changes

  * CUDA solver release, provided in full source and as an example of
    coupling external linear equation solvers with FOAM

  * Library-level support for Immersed Boundary Method and Overset
    Mesh

  * Major improvements in accuracy and stability of FVM discretisation
    with options on convection and diffusion discretisation, deferred
    correction or explicit schemes

  * Algebraic multigrid solver framework

  * 267 tutorials with automated run scripts

  * Automatic test harness

  * Approximately 6000 bug fixes in fundamental level libraries and
    discretisation techniques
