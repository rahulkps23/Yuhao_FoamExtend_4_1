Description
    Transient/steady-state segregated finite-volume solver for large strain
    elastic orthotropic solid bodies allowing for general principal material
    directions.

    Displacement increment field DU is solved for using an updated Lagrangian
    approach,
    also generating the Almansi strain tensor field epsilon and Cauchy stress
    tensor field sigma.

    At the end of each time-step, the mesh is moved and sigma, epsilon and C
    are rotated to the new configuration.
