Application
    MRFPorousFoam

Description
    Steady-state solver for incompressible, turbulent flow, with implicit
    coupling between pressure and velocity achieved by fvBlockMatrix.
    Turbulence is in this version solved using the existing turbulence
    structure.

    Added support for MRF and porous zones
